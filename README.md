This is the solution to an interview problem that was posed to me. 

The goal was to build a series of functions that will act like a "canvas" and "draw" tool which supports the following functions: 

1) Draw Straight lines (Horizontal and Vertical)
2) Draw Boxes 
3) Bucket Fill 
4) Unit Tests


I am slowly fleshing it out from the initial project I submitted.
Partof the roadmap includes: 

1) Using MVC design with Backbone, Marionette (though thinking about using angularjs) 
2) Switch from direct dom manipulation to using jQuery (I originally wanted to keep it light/raw javascript) 
3) Use validator.js
4) Add requirejs text loading plugin
5) add bower, grunt and npm support.
6) possibly include a backend for saving the various canvas (maybe do it with Meteorjs?)
